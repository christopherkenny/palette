`palette` provides a lightweight infrastructure for working with color palettes in R.
The primary goal is to place colors directly next to their character representations.
To do this, we create a palette class based on [`vctrs`](https://vctrs.r-lib.org/index.html).
We then provide methods for this class, including `print()`, `plot()`, and [`pillar`](https://pillar.r-lib.org/). 
To keep it lightweight and usable in other packages, the only direct dependencies are `vctrs`, `cli`, and `pillar`.

## Installation

You can install the development version of palette from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages('pak')
pak::pak('christopherkenny/palette')
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(palette)
## basic example code
```

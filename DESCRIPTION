Description: Hexadecimal codes are typically used to represent colors in R. 
    Connecting these codes to their colors requires practice or memorization.
    'palette' provides a 'vctrs' class for working with color palettes, including 
    printing and plotting functions. The goal of the class is to place visual 
    representations of color palettes directly on or, at least, next to their 
    corresponding character representations. Palette extensions also are provided 
    for data frames using 'pillar'.

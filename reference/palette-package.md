# palette: Color Scheme Helpers

Hexadecimal codes are typically used to represent colors in R.
Connecting these codes to their colors requires practice or
memorization. 'palette' provides a 'vctrs' class for working with color
palettes, including printing and plotting functions. The goal of the
class is to place visual representations of color palettes directly on
or, at least, next to their corresponding character representations.
Palette extensions also are provided for data frames using 'pillar'.
